# snake
This is a recreation of the classic game Snake in c++ using SDL2, I plan to eventually rebuild this in C, but wanted to get it working in C++ before I continue in C.

#TODO
Add Score
Refactor functions in Apple and Snake to be in functions instead of the struct
Add fullscreen
Add input for screen resolution
Better manage the fps as it feels extremely fast currrently
